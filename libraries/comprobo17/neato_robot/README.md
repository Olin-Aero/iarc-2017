## Neato Drivers

This repository contains the Neato ROS drivers, catkinized, and ready for ROS Groovy and newer.

## Usage
You can check this out into your catin workspace as follows:

    cd <ws>/src
    git clone https://github.com/mikeferguson/neato_robot.git
    cd <ws>
    catkin_make
    source <ws>/devel/setup.bash

## Changes for Groovy (version 0.2.x)

 * 2dnav_neato is now named neato_2dnav in order to comply with newer naming conventions.
 * neato_driver directory structure is slightly changed to comply with catkin_python_setup requirements.
